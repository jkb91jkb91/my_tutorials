If you set >>> localhost instead of domain/IP address and clone looks like that >> git remote add origin git@localhost:root/gitflow.git  
You want be able to clone even if you have SSH Keys , onlu such will work >> git remote add origin git@25.223.44.15:root/gitflow.git


so in docker-compose set IP/domain name
